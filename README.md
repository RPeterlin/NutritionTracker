NutritionTracker is a personal project which is still a work in progress. The original purpose was to learn fundamental front-end concepts in React while producing an app that would be used to track daily macros in place of an Excel spreadsheet.

The "tech stack" consists of React (with React Router v6) and Firebase for user authentication and CRUD operations.

It is currently available at https://nutrition-tracker-26769.web.app/

In the future we should add some meaningful homepage text and an option for users to add images of their meals. Ideally, the app would be made usable for mobile users as well.
